# Project Challenges # 

- Vulnerability research:  relating vulnerabilities found on the fly then matching these to exploits; this aspect demands thoroughness.

- Mitigation research: What approaches are feasible ?  What is the most appropriate solution for each of the vulnerabilities ?

- Avoiding detection: How could an attacker act more stealthily to avoid detection ?  What can a defender do to mitigate this ?

- Time pressure: Working on multiple aspects at the same time whilst gathering details for documentation and reports at each step.

# Most Exacting Aspect # 

- Exploring network activity, utilizing more wireshark functionality to detail anomolies / suspicious activities.  Requires precision and lateral thought.

# Experience Gained # 

- Kibana Watcher: learned to use the Watcher feature for the different beats, defining specific alert criteria and setting appropriate thresholds.
